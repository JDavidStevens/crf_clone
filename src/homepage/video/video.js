                <p className='video-paragraph'>Humans love to perform at a high level. We love competition. Who can run the fastest. Which team can score the most. And when it comes to powersports, the competition is fierce. Motocross, enduro, GNCC, hare and hounds, desert racing, or just riding with your pals and seeing who can get to the top of that hill first. This year Hondaâ€™s CRF performance lineup is stronger than ever, with new bikes, new features, and one overriding goal: Winning.</p>
